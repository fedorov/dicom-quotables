# About

DICOM is a somewhat complicated standard used in medical imaging, primarily
in clinical imaging. If you don't know anything about it, then you can probably
stop reading this, as this repository will be of little interest to you.

I created this repository partially to keep track of funny quotes, but also
perhaps to raise awareness of how people in the academic imaging research
community sometimes think about DICOM.

All quotes are anonymous. I have a lot of respect to the actual people who said
those, and it is not my intent to offend them. I believe these quotes are quite
benign, but they highlight certain trend, and I believe can be entertaining to
DICOM geeks.

Enjoy, and feel free to contribute your quotes to the collection, while keeping
the content respectful and non-inflammatory!
